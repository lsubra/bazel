1. Maven's default validation of systemscoped deps requires absolute paths.
2. No env variables are substituted by Bazel before invoking this validation,
   which usually leads to problems when ${java.home} is used in system scoped
   paths.


First attempt was to set JAVA_HOME (bazel run doesn't do it since it controls the
env variables) using "runner". But even that did not work due to (2) above. So,
finally, we just removed the validation !
